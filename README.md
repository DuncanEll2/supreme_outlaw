SUPREME OUTLAW

This is a WIP outlaw system, that will limit a players usage to things if they become an outlaw. If a player becomes an outlaw you can restrict them from doing robberys, accessing there bank account and so on. This is a WIP so its far from finished but its funtional as is. It comes with exports to set a player as an outlaw and an export to check a players outlaw status which can be integrated into other scripts. Feel free to contribute to this and fix anything thats unoptimised.

Theres no really need for a preview as its a fairly simple script.

Add 'outlaw' to players table with TINYINIT(1)

Future updates will consist of,

On screen outlaw status
Its on database table

exports:
IsPlayerOutlaw
SetPlayerAsOutlaw
